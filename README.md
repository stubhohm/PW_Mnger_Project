-- Over-Arching Premise --
The goal of this project is to make a 'secure' password manager with an API.

-- Intended Components --
Full back end project with a 'secure' manager program written in python.
Full front end with API to interact with the python programs to allow for hacking into the box.

-- Current State --
I am beginning with the backend development since I am most familiar with python and will be useing this to build the logic of the program.
As of now the program will all you to create a new user account if the username is unique and stores the username, salt and hashed password.
